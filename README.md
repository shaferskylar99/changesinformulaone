How Has Formula One Changed?
Skylar Shafer, ECON 570, Group 19

Introduction
Formula One is an international racing phenomenon, featuring cars that race in excess of 200 MPH. As a sport of extremely high notoriety which pushes mechanical limits, it has a long and complex history filled with triumph, tragedy, and technological progress.
In Formula One, racers take to the track to prove their mettle over multiple days of racing. Drivers complete qualifying laps in the preliminary days in an attempt to achieve a higher starting position in the actual race held on the final day.
I wanted to look at how the dynamics of racing at each circuit have changed over time. I also was curious about how the sport has changed over time. Are the cars/drivers more reliable or consistent? Has the competitive gap between good and bad teams increased or decreased? Below are the results of my foray into this research, along with some insights I’ve derived from them.
Data Overview
Before we can analyze the most iconic tracks, we must assess what constitutes an iconic track. I will use the definition that a track is considered great if it has been used more than 30 times for Formula One races, since Formula One’s creation in 1950. The following courses are considered great by this definition:
1.	Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, in Barcelona, Spain
2.	Circuit de Monaco, in Monaco, a tiny country on the southern coast of France
3.	Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada
4.	Silverstone Circuit, in the East Midlands of England, in the United Kingdom
5.	Hockenheimring, near Hockenheim, in the Rhine Valley of Germany
6.	Hungaroring, in Mogyorod, Hungary
7.	Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, in Belgium
8.	Autodromo Nazionale Monza, North of Milan, Italy
9.	Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, or Interlagos, in São Paulo, Brazil
10.	Nurburgring, in Nurburg, Germany, in the Rhineland
11.	Suzuka Circuit, in Suzuka, Japan
12.	Circuit Zandvoort or Circuit Park Zandvoort, on the coast of the Netherlands

We will compare these circuits, and F1 in general, by 3 standard metrics:
1.	Retire rate or the proportion of all racers to have raced at the track in the given period who failed to finish the race, in order to assess the difficulty of finishing a given race.
2.	The average change in position for those who finished the race, in order to assess the excitement of results created by overtaking. If the expectations of where teams will finish (based on how they qualified, and thus their starting position) are often wrong, then the races are likely more exciting, with more overtakes.
3.	The average starting position of those who failed to finish the race, as a means of assessing the difference in performance between top teams and bottom teams. If those teams starting in the back are much less likely to finish the race, the gap in car engineering/driver skill is likely larger, and so the gap between teams is, as well.

	We will also look at how these metrics look for all races over the whole history of F1, from 1950 to 2021, in a time series format, depending on the chronological order of when each race occurred, not the date itself. Thus, we can get a perspective on how racing has changed not only at each of the iconic circuits but throughout the entirety of the competition.

Analysis

Insight 1: Cars and/or Drivers have clearly become more reliable

When I first started my research on this topic, I didn’t realize how often F1 drivers failed to finish a given race, historically. Looking first at figure 5, we can clearly see that at times as recent as the 1990s, car retirement rate moving averages were well over .5, meaning over half of racers would often fail to finish. This could be due to several factors, such as driver skill, car reliability or ease of use, as well as a combination of both car and driver issues. Either way, since the early 1990s, retirement rates have plummeted.  

This trend is also evident in the bar chart of figure 2, in which every iconic F1 racetrack saw a significant decrease in retirement rate. This effectively rules out any possibility that this drop in retirements could be due to a change in tracks, so it must be either car or driver who has improved, or likely both.

Insight 2: Street circuits may be suffering from the new F1 car

Formula One, throughout its history, has often used street circuits, none more famous than the Monaco Grand Prix. Historically, as you can see in figures 1, 2, and 3, it had some unique qualities. The average change in position for finishers was among the highest of all grand prix, the retirement rate was the highest of the iconic circuits, and the average starting position of those who failed to finish was the lowest of the iconic circuits (meaning that those who started in a better position were more likely to crash). Thus, it had ample overtaking and was difficult to maneuver to the point where it even presented a unique challenge for the highest quality racers. 

For these reasons, as well as many more, Monaco has often been called the crown jewel of Formula One. To win there is to win the biggest race of the calendar besides a title decider. Yet, today, the status of the Monaco Grand Prix as a race of excitement has taken a hit.

Figures 1, 2, and 3 back these claims somewhat, but not conclusively. The overtake rate at Monaco is now one of the lowest, but the two other metrics still put Monaco where it was compared to the other iconic grand prix before. 

So why do F1 fans complain about Monaco? It is mainly the overtaking aspect, which I believe suffers for a single primary reason, the size of the cars. Today, F1 cars are significantly bigger than they were in historical F1. This allows for more power and speed in the car but makes it much harder to pass another car in a space as narrow as many street circuits get. Monaco is a track down the streets of a European city, and so is not wide enough to easily sustain two F1 cars next to each other. Thus, there is little overtaking, which damages the race’s entertainment value.

Racetracks that are only used for racing, such as Silverstone or Nürburgring, have benefitted comparatively from the changes in the cars. There is more space for the cars to push speed and power to the limit. Nürburgring is a great example of this. In figure 1 you can see that the change in final position in recent times at Nürburgring is the highest of all iconic circuits. 


Insight 3: The competitive gap in F1 goes through cycles, but is likely growing

As you can see in figure 4, the overtake rate has decreased, which indicates that racers generally finished closer to where they qualified, indicating less competition between drivers. In figure 6, you see a constant changing of the moving averages of the starting position of those who failed to finish. Every few years, this pattern restarts. I think this could be due in part to a unique aspect of Formula One’s rules.

In Formula One, every few years, the rules and regulations of the cars are redefined. Thus, teams are constantly having to build a new car from scratch every few years, and then they can refine it in the years that follow before starting over again. Thus, the pecking order constantly changes in these cycles, and teams shift around at the beginning before finding their pecking order by the end of a car generation’s life cycle before it is all jumbled and shifted again. In this jumbling phase, competition is more intense, but as the cars are refined, they gradually separate. So, the competitive gap is cyclical.
	
Looking at figure 6, we can see that the line of best fit does indicate an increase in the starting position of those who failed to finish over time. This could mean that the cars in the worse teams are comparatively less reliable than they were comparatively before, or it could be a gap in driver skill, or both. Regardless, this gap appears to be widening.

In turn, looking at the results of figures 4 and 6, I would say that Formula One is generally becoming less competitive, with the gap between teams widening.

Conclusion

	F1 has changed a lot in its history. It has evolved with technology, seeing new feats of engineering and driver prowess that many would have not thought possible decades ago. It is a constantly evolving sport. The cars and/or drivers have become much more reliable. The optimal racing circumstances have changed due to the new cars, and Formula One will have to look at street circuits and how they have suffered at the expense of advancement of technology. The gap between teams is also growing, as teams at the top expand their lead on the teams at the bottom, although every few years, the pecking order is redefined. Overall, though, the sport has kept its place as the face of global racing, and I believe the future of it will hold moments of excitement and brilliance. As F1 is a unique hybrid of traditional sport and technology, its future could take many directions as we develop new technology capable of daunting feats. I have thoroughly enjoyed looking at the history of this great competition as well as its present state, and I look froward to enjoying the future of it, as well.
